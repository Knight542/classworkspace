  <h1> Alignment </h1>
    <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page">  Bricklink Homepaget</a>
     <ul>
      <li> Very neatly laid out and spaced. </li>
      <li> The primary categories are higher, as they are more broad than the lower categories. </li>
      <li> I just thought it was cool that most of it is lined up in squares and rectangles, like order lego bricks. </li>
     </ul>
  <br />
  <h1> Contrast </h1>
    <a href="https://roll20.net/">  Roll20</a>
     <ol>
      <li> The magenta/purple fade decals, and black text contrast with the white and light gray background. </li>
      <li> Uses three separate fonts to group different elements of the page. </li>
      <li> Any hover windows have a shadow around the boarder, to make sure it doesn't blend with the main page. <li>
  <br />
  <h1> Proximity </h1>
    <a href="https://lawrencehallofscience.org">  Lawrence Hall of Science</a>

      <dt> Lawrence Hall? </dt>
      <dd>- I chose this website because I was actually renewing my volunteer info, whoops! </dd>
      <dt> Use of Proximity? </dt>
      <dd>- As you scroll down he homepage, you should notice that, for the most part, text stays mostly the same height as the accopmanying images, or if it is different, is usually within a 1/3rd difference (following the rule of 3rds), and leaves plenty of space so as not to be confused with the next section. </dd>
      <dt> Why do I think it's good Proximity? </dt>
      <dd>- Mainly because it follows the rules (for the most part), but also because it incorperates smaller pieces of other elements, mainly Contrast.

  <h1> Repitition </hi>
    <a href="https://www.zelda.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/">  The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Homepage</a>
     <ol type="I">
      <li> Very simple, single page, scroll for info. </li>
      <li> Each segment alternates between a colorful background, and an interactive background of ancient murals. </li>
      <li> Personally, I think it is a good representation of Alignment, Contrast, and Repitition, but I needed something for this category. </li>
     </ol>
